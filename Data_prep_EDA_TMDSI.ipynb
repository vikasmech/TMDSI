In its broadest sense, every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing. It usually involves using email to send advertisements, request business, or solicit sales or donations, and is meant to build loyalty, trust, or brand awareness. Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database. The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant's relationship with current or previous customers, encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business, acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately, and sharing third-party ads. </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> (hide) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Types <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Transactional emails </Li> <Li> 2.2 Direct emails <Ul> <Li> 2.2. 1 Mobile email marketing </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Comparison to traditional mail <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Advantages </Li> <Li> 3.2 Disadvantages </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Opt-in email advertising </Li> <Li> 5 Legal requirements <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Australia </Li> <Li> 5.2 Canada </Li> <Li> 5.3 European Union </Li> <Li> 5.4 United States </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History </H2> <P> Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century.

In 1978, Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET). This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products, and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails. However, as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication, users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs. In order to effectively communicate a message through email, marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user, without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software. This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails, which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns. </P> <P> Historically, it has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns because target markets can not be adequately defined. Email marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns on investment and measure and improve efficiency. Email marketing allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time, and to monitor how effective their campaign is in achieving market penetration, revealing a communication channel's scope. At the same time, however, it also means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods, such as television advertisements, can not be captured. </P> <H2> Types </H2> <P> Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails:</P> <H3> Transactional emails </H3> <P> Transactional emails are usually triggered based on a customer's action with a company. To be qualified as transactional or relationship messages, these communications' primary purpose must be \"to facilitate, complete, or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender\" along with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging. Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages, password reset emails, purchase or order confirmation emails, order status emails, reorder emails, and email receipts. </P> <P> The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it. But, due to their high open rates (51.3% compared to 36.6% for email newsletters), transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer questions ; or to cross-sell or up-sell products or services. </P> <P> Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support, which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails. There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services, which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns (such as customer referral programs). </P> <H3> Direct emails </H3> <P> Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message (for example, a special offer or a product catalog). Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to, or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies. Safe mail marketing is also used. </P> Mobile email marketing <P> Email marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets. Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users and to make them view advertising for longer. However, the rate of delivery is still relatively low due to better filtering-out of advertising and users having multiple email accounts for different purposes. Because emails are generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers, it is possible to send advertising which is based on the recipient's behavior. Because of this, modern email marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather than a push strategy. </P> <H2> Comparison to traditional mail </H2> <P> There are both advantages and disadvantages to using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail. </P> <H3> Advantages </H3> <P> Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons:</P> <Ul> <Li> An exact return on investment can be tracked (\"track to basket\") and has proven to be high when done properly. Email marketing is often reported as second only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing tactic. </Li> <Li> Email marketing is significantly cheaper and faster than traditional mail, mainly because of the high cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for producing the artwork, printing, addressing, and mailing. </Li> <Li> Businesses and organizations who send a high volume of emails can use an ESP (email service provider) to gather information about the behavior of the recipients. The insights provided by consumer response to email marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of consumer behavior. </Li> <Li> Email provides a cost-effective method to test different marketing content, including visual, creative, marketing copy, and multimedia assets. The data gathered by testing in the email channel can then be used across all channels of marketing campaigns, both print and digital. </Li> <Li> Advertisers can reach substantial numbers of email subscribers who have opted in (i.e., consented) to receive the email. </Li> <Li> Almost half of American Internet users check or send email on a typical day, with emails delivered between 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent at other times in open and click rates. </Li> <Li> Email is popular with digital marketers, rising an estimated 15% in 2009 to £ 292 million in the UK. </Li> <Li> If compared to standard email, direct email marketing produces higher response rate and higher average order value for e-commerce businesses. </Li> </Ul> <H3> Disadvantages </H3> <P> As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers. According to the report, legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73% in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as spam, and 22% were missing. This lags behind other countries:Australia delivers at 90%, Canada at 89%, Britain at 88%, France at 84%, Germany at 80% and Brazil at 79%. </P> <P> Additionally, consumers receive on average circa 90 emails per day. </P> <P> Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM), the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003, or their Internet service provider's acceptable use policy. </P> <H2> Opt-in email advertising </H2> <P> Opt-in email advertising, or permission marketing, is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it. This method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate the disadvantages of email marketing. </P> <P> Opt-in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver. This system is intended to eventually result in a high degree of satisfaction between consumers and marketers. If opt-in email advertising is used, the material that is emailed to consumers will be \"anticipated\". It is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it, which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer. Ideally, opt-in email advertisements will be more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements. </P> <P> A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm's customers. Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions, or new products. In this type of advertising, a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter. </P> <P> With a foundation of opted-in contact information stored in their database, marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing. They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments. </P> <H2> Legal requirements </H2> <H3> Australia </H3> <P> The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, widely known as \"ACMA\". The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages, states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages, and gives other key information. Fines range with 3 fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines (2011), Tiger Airways Holdings Limited (2012) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited (2013). </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The \"Canada Anti-Spam Law\" (CASL) went into effect on July 1, 2014. CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt-in from users, and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses. </P> <H3> European Union </H3> <P> In 2002 the European Union (EU) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications. Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes. The Directive establishes the opt-in regime, where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not apply to business email addresses. </P> <P> The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states. In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication. </P> <H3> United states </H3> <P> The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 was passed by Congress as a direct response of the growing number of complaints over spam e-mails. Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally, that those who send commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them, and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them. The act authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient. However, it does not ban spam emailing outright, but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are \"materially false or misleading\". In addition there are conditions which email marketers must meet in terms of their format, their content and labeling. As a result, many commercial email marketers within the United States utilize a service or special software to ensure compliance with the act. A variety of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with the act. To comply with the act's regulation of commercial email, services also typically require users to authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address, provide a one-click unsubscribe feature, and prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have given valid permission. </P> <P> In addition to satisfying legal requirements, email service providers (ESPs) began to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing campaigns. The service providers supply email templates and general best practices, as well as methods for handling subscriptions and cancellations automatically. Some ESPs will provide insight and assistance with deliverability issues for major email providers. They also provide statistics pertaining to the number of messages received and opened, and whether the recipients clicked on any links within the messages. </P> <P> The CAN-SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a no-fee provision for opting out, further definition of \"sender\", post office or private mail boxes count as a \"valid physical postal address\" and definition of \"person\". These new provisions went into effect on July 7, 2008. </P> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> CAUCE -- Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email </Li> <Li> Customer engagement </Li> <Li> Suppression list </Li> <Li> Email spam-Unsolicited email marketing </Li> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ \"spam unsolicited e-mail\".

The show, narrated by Future Ted, tells the story of how Ted Mosby met The Mother. Tracy McConnell appears in 8 episodes from \"Lucky Penny\" to \"The Time Travelers\" as an unseen character ; she was first seen fully in \"Something New\" and was promoted to a main character in season 9. The Mother is played by Cristin Milioti. </P> <P> The story of how Ted met The Mother is the framing device behind the series ; many facts about her are revealed throughout the series, including the fact that Ted once unwittingly owned her umbrella before accidentally leaving it behind in her apartment. Ted and The Mother meet at the Farhampton train station following Barney Stinson and Robin Scherbatsky's wedding ; this scene is shown in \"Last Forever\", the series finale. The Mother's death from an unspecified terminal illness in 2024, also revealed in the series finale, received a mixed reaction from fans. </P> <P> An alternate ending was released in the ninth season DVD. In the alternate ending, Tracy Mosby is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030. In the video, future Ted is heard saying, ``... When I think how lucky I am to wake up next to your mom every morning, I ca n't help but be amazed how easy it all really was...\", indirectly stating that The Mother is alive. The video ends right after the train passes at Farhampton station and credits start rolling, implying that Ted never went back to Robin as he lived a successful married life with Tracy Mosby. </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> (hide) <Ul> <Li> 1 Casting </Li> <Li> 2 Character history <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Name </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Death </Li> <Li> 4 Notes </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Casting (edit) </H2> <P> During its first eight seasons, the successful sitcom How I Met Your Mother often hinted at the unseen character of The Mother. Well-known actresses often made guest appearances on the show. Many fans expected that another would play one of the most-wanted roles in Hollywood, but creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas wanted an unknown. Using Anne Hathaway and Amy Adams as examples, Thomas said that \"We did n't want it to be a big famous star because we did n't want the wider audience to have associations with whatever actress this would be... The whole idea is that Ted's never seen this woman before, so it better feel that way to the audience\", similar to how Cobie Smulders being cast as Robin Scherbatsky had \"kept the show alive\" when it began. Bays and Thomas also did not want a large casting call. </P> <P> They chose Cristin Milioti after seeing her on 30 Rock and Once ; her musical ability was also helpful, as The Mother had been described as a band member. After competing for the role against at least two others, Milioti filmed her first scene -- for the last episode of season 8 -- having never watched How I Met Your Mother ; she recalled, \"I had ignorance on my side. So I did n't know what it meant.\" Milioti learned of the character's importance only after binge watching the show during the summer. </P> <H2> Character history (edit) </H2> <P> The Mother was born on September 19, 1984. </P> <P> The Mother, joined by her roommate Kelly awaits the arrival of her boyfriend Max only to receive a call informing her of his death. After the funeral service, she returns to the apartment to open Max's last gift to her -- a ukulele. The Mother spends the next few years grieving the passing of the man she believes was her one true love. </P> <P> In \"Wait for It\", it is revealed that the short story of how they met involved her yellow umbrella. In \"No Tomorrow\", Ted finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after attending a St. Patrick's Day party which she also attended, as it had been two and a half years since the death of Max, her late boyfriend. She is still grieving, but her roommate Kelly encourages her to go out and date again, bringing her to the same bar where Ted and Barney are celebrating. The two women run into Mitch, her old orchestra instructor ; The Mother offers to give Mitch her cello for his work at a school and they head to her apartment. After they start talking, Mitch encourages her to pursue her dreams. The Mother expresses her desire to end poverty by taking up economics in college. </P> <P> On his first day of teaching as Professor Mosby, as seen in the season 4 finale \"The Leap\", he is seen in front of the classroom of students, one of which Future Ted says is the titular mother. But in the first episode of season 5, \"Definitions\", it is revealed that he was actually in the wrong classroom -- Economics instead of Architecture. At the same time in \"How Your Mother Met Me\", the Mother sits her first session in Economics 305 and meets another graduate student named Cindy (Rachel Bilson), whom she offers to move in with her as her roommate. They see Ted enter the room, but when he announces the subject, The Mother thinks she is in the wrong room and runs off. She heads back to the room after seeing Ted scramble to his actual classroom. </P> <P> Later, in \"Girls Versus Suits\", Ted dates Cindy, not knowing that her roommate is his future wife. Throughout the episode, Ted notes that Cindy had spent most of their first date talking jealously about her roommate. When in Cindy and the mother's apartment he picks up many of The Mother's belongings, attempting to show how compatible he and Cindy are (thinking the items are Cindy's) and glimpses the mother's foot as she disappears into her room after taking a shower. Ted finds out at this time that she plays bass guitar in a band. Ted forgets to take the yellow umbrella with him when he goes out and Future Ted mentions, \"this is how your mother got her yellow umbrella back.\" In \"How Your Mother Met Me\", it is revealed that, after Ted left the apartment, the Mother had discovered the umbrella and, upon going to question Cindy, finds her in a state. As she tried to console her, Cindy said that she was a much better match for Ted, and began to lovingly list all of the reasons that Ted would find the mother attractive, before spontaneously kissing her, revealing that her jealousy towards her roommate was actually a crush. While this incident made Cindy realise that she is a lesbian, it also made the Mother decide to go back into dating, as the kiss was her first in a long time. </P> <P> Some time after this, a man named Darren approaches The Mother and is welcomed into her band named Superfreakonomics. Darren gradually takes over the band. </P> <P> In the season 6 opener \"Big Days\" it is revealed Ted meets his future wife \"the day of\" the wedding at which he is the best man. In the episode \"False Positive\" Robin asks Ted to be her future best man, should she ever get married. In the episode \"Challenge Accepted\", it is revealed that Ted meets the mother of his children the day of Barney's wedding. In the last episode of season 7, \"The Magician's Code\" it is shown that Barney will marry Robin, and Ted will meet the mother \"the day of\" their wedding. On the premiere of season 8, Ted's wife appears after Barney and Robin's wedding, outside at the \"Farhampton\" station while holding a yellow umbrella and her bass guitar. </P> <P> In the season 8 episode \"Band or DJ ?,\" Ted runs into Cindy on the subway and tells her that the band Barney and Robin hired to play at their wedding cancelled at the last minute. The end result of the encounter is that Cindy's (now ex-) roommate's band plays at Barney and Robin's wedding. </P> <P> The Mother is first shown meeting Louis in \"How Your Mother Met Me\" as she is left to carry the band equipment while the now-lead band member Darren talks to his fans. Later at MacLaren's Pub, she tells him she's not yet ready to date. Louis asks her to give him a call if she changes her mind and they begin dating not long after. </P> <P> The Mother meets all of Ted's best friends (Barney, Lily, Marshall and Robin) before she meets him. The Mother is responsible for convincing Barney to pursue Robin, as revealed through a flashback in \"Platonish\". In \"The Locket\", Tracy meets Lily on a train journey. </P> <P> In \"Bass Player Wanted\", the Mother picks up a hitchhiking Marshall, carrying his son Marvin, on her way to Farhampton Inn. On their way, it is revealed that the Mother is a bass player in the band, that is scheduled to play at the wedding reception. But the band's leader, Darren, forced her to quit. The Mother ultimately decides to confront Darren and retake the band. She ends up alone at the bar, and while practicing a speech to give Darren, Darren walks up to her furious the groom's best man punched him for \"no reason.\" Amused by this, the Mother laughs, and Darren quits the band in anger. </P> <P> In \"How Your Mother Met Me\", it is shown that after this incident, the Mother returns to Louis' summer cottage not far from the Farhampton Inn where she has been staying for the duration of the wedding weekend. As she walks in the door, Louis proposes to her, but she goes outside to think about it for a few minutes. She declines Louis' proposal and leaves his cottage, going to check in at Farhampton Inn. On her room's balcony, she plays the ukulele and sings \"La Vie en Rose\". Ted hears her singing from his room next door. </P> <P> In \"Gary Blauman\", Ted and the Mother are on their first date. Ted picks her up at her New York City apartment and they proceed to walk to a Scottish-Mexican fusion restaurant for dinner. On the way there, Ted is telling her a story when they nearly have a run-in with Louis. She says that she is in the \"weirdest place on earth\" right now and that it is too soon for her to be dating. Ted walks her back to her apartment. They say goodnight and Ted begins to walk away. The Mother then stops him and asks him to finish the story he was telling her. When the story is over, they say goodnight again. The Mother takes a step towards Ted and they kiss for the first time, before deciding to carry on their date. </P> <P> In a flashforward in \"The Lighthouse\", Ted proposes to the Mother at the top of the lighthouse near Farhampton Inn. She immediately accepts. In another flashfoward in \"Unpause\", the Mother is revealed to be pregnant with their second child, Luke, in the year 2017. She goes into labor while she and Ted are staying at Farhampton. </P> <H3> Name (edit) </H3> <P> The Mother's real name is not revealed until the series finale, \"Last Forever\". When Ted meets her at the Farhampton train station, she reveals that her name is Tracy McConnell. In the season 1 episode \"Belly Full of Turkey\", Ted meets a stripper named Tracy and says ``... that, kids, is the true story of how I met your mother\". The children react in surprise and appear to believe Ted before he admits he is joking, which led some fans to correctly guess that The Mother's name is Tracy. </P> <H2> Death (edit) </H2> See also:Last Forever <P> In the series finale, it is revealed that six years prior to Ted telling the story to his children, Tracy died in 2024 from an undisclosed illness. In the finale the characters do not directly state that the mother is dead. Ted says that she \"became sick\" and his children saying that she has been \"gone\" for six years. Many fans expressed considerable disappointment to The Mother's death. Milioti cried when she learned her character was supposed to die, but came to accept the ending was what the writers had planned from the beginning. Bill Kuchman from Popculturology said that The Mother was \"an amazing character\" and that \"over the course of this final season HIMYM made us care about Tracy. Kuchman said that \"asking fans to drop all of that with a simple line about The Mother getting sick and passing away was a very difficult request\", that the finale \"advanced too quickly\" and that \"HIMYM was a victim of its own success on this issue\". </P> <P> A petition was started, aiming to rewrite and reshoot the finale. The petition has over 20,000 signatures and considerable online news coverage. On April 5, 2014, Carter Bays announced on Twitter that an alternate ending would be included on the Season 9 DVD. No new material was shot for this scene. In the alternate ending, the mother is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030. </P> <H2> Notes (edit) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ The Mother celebrates her 21st birthday on the day that \"Pilot\" is set.

She had a brother who committed suicide. Her parents chose the name \"Pom\" because it is similar in pronunciation to the Korean words for both \"spring\" (봄) and \"tiger\" (범). Klementieff lived in Canada for one year before her family traveled extensively due to her father's job, and she lived in Japan and the Ivory Coast before settling in France. Klementieff later said that travelling at an early age gave her a \"gypsy soul\". </P> <P> Klementieff's father died of cancer when she was 5, and her mother was schizophrenic and unable to care for children, so Klementieff was raised by her paternal uncle and aunt. Her uncle, whom she described as \"like my second father\", died on her 18th birthday. Klementieff briefly attended law school after her uncle's death to appease her aunt, but did not find the career path appealing. She also worked as a waitress and saleswoman in France. She started acting at age 19 at the Cours Florent drama school in Paris. A few months into her education, she won a theater competition that awarded her free classes for two years with the school's top teachers. </P> <H2> Career (edit) </H2> Klementieff in 2018 <P> Klementieff's first professional acting job was the French independent film Après lui (2007), portraying the stepdaughter of the protagonist played by Catherine Deneuve. Filming for her scenes took three days. During one scene, Klementieff was supposed to push someone down a set of stairs but accidentally fell down the stairs herself, and director Gaël Morel kept that shot in the final film. Her first leading role was in Loup (2009), a French film about a tribe of reindeer herders in the Siberian mountains. During filming, Klementieff stayed in a camp, hours from the nearest village, where temperatures dropped well below zero. During filming she befriended nomads who lived there, worked with real wolves, rode reindeer, and swam with a horse in a lake. </P> <P> Klementieff made her Hollywood debut in Spike Lee's Oldboy (2013), a remake of the South Korean film of the same name. She portrayed Haeng-Bok, the bodyguard of the antagonist played by Sharlto Copley. A fan of the original film, Klementieff heard about the part through Roy Lee, a producer with the remake, and took boxing lessons after learning the role involved martial arts. After showcasing her boxing skills during her audition, Lee asked her to go home and come back wearing a more feminine outfit and make-up, like her character in the film. She contributed some of her own clothes to the character's wardrobe, and trained three hours a day for two months for an on-screen fight with star Josh Brolin. Klementieff came up with the name Haeng-Bok, Korean for \"happiness\", herself after Lee asked her to research possible names for the character. </P> <P> Klementieff moved to Los Angeles after Oldboy was filmed and began pursuing more Hollywood auditions. She continued taekwondo after the film, and has a purple belt as of the summer of 2014. Her next acting role was the film Hacker's Game (2015), in which she plays a hacker she compared to Lisbeth Salander from the novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Klementieff used her boxing skills again in the film, and due to the movie's low budget, she had to do her own make-up and chose her own wardrobe. It was her idea to dye her hair purple for the role, to which the directors first objected but later acquiesced. She joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe with her role as Mantis in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) and will appear in the same role in the film Avengers:Infinity War (2018). </P> <H2> Filmography (edit) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Year </Th> <Th> Title </Th> <Th> Role </Th> <Th> Notes </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2007 </Td> <Td> Après lui </Td> <Td> Emilie </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2008 </Td> <Td> The Easy Way </Td> <Td> NHI </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2009 </Td> <Td> Loup </Td> <Td> Nastazya </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2009 </Td> <Td> Pigalle, la nuit </Td> <Td> Sandra </Td> <Td> TV series (eight episodes) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2011 </Td> <Td> Borderline </Td> <Td> Naomi </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2011 </Td> <Td> Sleepless Night </Td> <Td> Lucy </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2011 </Td> <Td> Delicacy </Td> <Td> Waitress </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2011 </Td> <Td> Love Lasts Three Years </Td> <Td> Julia </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2011 </Td> <Td> Silhouettes </Td> <Td> Valerie </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2012 </Td> <Td> Radiostars </Td> <Td> The pizza girl </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2012 </Td> <Td> Porn in the Hood </Td> <Td> Tia </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2012 </Td> <Td> À l'ombre du palmier </Td> <Td> Le modèle </Td> <Td> Short film </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2012 </Td> <Td> El Turrrf </Td> <Td> Pom </Td> <Td> Short film </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2013 </Td> <Td> Paris à tout prix </Td> <Td> Jess </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2013 </Td> <Td> Oldboy </Td> <Td> Haeng-Bok </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2014 </Td> <Td> RossFit </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> Short film </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2015 </Td> <Td> Hacker's Game </Td> <Td> Loise </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2016 </Td> <Td> Seed </Td> <Td> Cat </Td> <Td> Short film </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2017 </Td> <Td> Ingrid Goes West </Td> <Td> Harley Chung </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2017 </Td> <Td> Newness </Td> <Td> Bethany </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2017 </Td> <Td> Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 </Td> <Td> Mantis </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2017 </Td> <Td> Alteration </Td> <Td> Elsa </Td> <Td> Short film </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2018 </Td> <Td> Avengers:Infinity War </Td> <Td> Mantis </Td> <Td> Post-production </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2019 </Td> <Td> Untitled Avengers film </Td> <Td> Post-production </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> See also (edit) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Biography portal </Li> </Ul> <H2> References (edit) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ \"Qui es-tu Pom Klementieff ?/Who are you Pom Klementieff ?\".

It was an attempt \"to revive country sales, which had been devastated by the rise of rock ' n ' roll.\" </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> (hide) <Ul> <Li> 1 Origins </Li> <Li> 2 Countrypolitan </Li> <Li> 3 Country pop </Li> <Li> 4 Examples of the Nashville sound </Li> <Li> 5 Examples of Countrypolitan </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Origins (edit) </H2> <P> The Nashville sound was pioneered by staff at Decca Records, RCA Records and Columbia Records in Nashville, Tennessee, including manager Steve Sholes, record producers Chet Atkins, Owen Bradley, and Bob Ferguson, and recording engineer Bill Porter. They invented the form by replacing elements of the popular honky tonk style (fiddles, steel guitar, nasal lead vocals) with \"smooth\" elements from 1950s pop music (string sections, background vocals, crooning lead vocals), and using \"slick\" production, and pop music structures. The producers relied on a small group of studio musicians known as the Nashville A-Team, whose quick adaptability and creative input made them vital to the hit-making process. The Anita Kerr Quartet was the main vocal backing group in the early 1960s. In 1960, Time magazine reported that Nashville had \"nosed out Hollywood as the nation's second biggest (after New York) record-producing center.\" </P> <P> The term \"Nashville Sound\" was first mentioned in an article about Jim Reeves in 1958 in the Music Reporter and again in 1960 in a Time magazine article about Reeves. Other observers have identified several recordings that helped establish the early Nashville sound. Country historian Rich Kienzle says that \"Gone\", a Ferlin Husky hit recorded in November 1956, \"may well have pointed the way to the Nashville sound.\" Writer Colin Escott proclaims Jim Reeves' \"Four Walls\", recorded February 1957, to be the \"first ' Nashville sound ' record\", and Chet Atkins, the RCA-based producer and guitarist most often credited with being the sound's primary artistic brainchild, pointed to his production of Don Gibson's \"Oh Lonesome Me\" late that same year. </P> <P> In an essay published in Heartaches by the Number:Country Music's 500 Greatest Singles, David Cantwell argues that Elvis Presley's rock and roll recording of \"Do n't Be Cruel\" in July 1956 was the record that sparked the beginning of the era now called the Nashville sound. </P> <P> Regarding the Nashville sound, the record producer Owen Bradley stated, \"Now we 've cut out the fiddle and steel guitar and added choruses to country music. But it ca n't stop there. It always has to keep developing to keep fresh.\" </P> <H2> Countrypolitan (edit) </H2> Lynn Anderson <P> In the early 1960s, the Nashville sound began to be challenged by the rival Bakersfield sound on the country side and by the British Invasion on the pop side ; compounding these problems were the sudden deaths, in separate airplane crashes, of Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves, two of the Nashville Sound's biggest stars. Nashville's pop song structure became more pronounced and it morphed into what was called Countrypolitan-a smoother sound typified through the use of lush string arrangements with a real orchestra and often, background vocals provided by a choir. Countrypolitan was aimed straight at mainstream markets and it sold well throughout the later 1960s into the early 1970s. Among the architects of this sound were producers Billy Sherrill (who was instrumental in shaping Tammy Wynette's early career) and Glenn Sutton. Artists who typified the countrypolitan sound initially included Wynette, Glen Campbell (who recorded in Hollywood and not Nashville), Lynn Anderson, Charlie Rich, and Charley Pride, the latter being a rare example of a top-selling African-American country performer. </P> <P> The Bakersfield sound, and later outlaw country, dominated country music among aficionados while countrypolitan reigned on the pop charts. </P> <P> Upon being asked what the Nashville sound was, Chet Atkins would put his hand into his pocket, shake his loose change, and say \"That's what it is. It's the sound of money\". </P> <H2> Country pop (edit) </H2> Main article:Country pop <P> By the late 1970s and 1980s, many pop music singers picked up the countrypolitan style and created what is known as country pop, the fusion of country music and soft rock. </P> <H2> Examples of the Nashville sound (edit) </H2> <P> Classic examples of Nashville sound recordings:</P> <Ul> <Li> \"Four Walls\" by Jim Reeves (1957) </Li> <Li> \"Gone\" by Ferlin Husky (1957) </Li> <Li> \"A Fallen Star\" by Jimmy C.

The main broadcasters in the United Kingdom are Sky Sports, who broadcast 126 of the 168 televised games in the UK, and BT Sport. The BBC shows weekly highlights of the Premier League on its Match of the Day and Match of the Day 2 programmes on Saturdays and Sundays. </P> <P> The 168 UK televised games are also broadcast across the world ; the remaining 212 matches that are n't broadcast live in the UK are all broadcast elsewhere around the world. English-speaking countries (excluding the UK) are able to carry what is known as the ' International feed ' or ' World feed ' audio ; this is full match commentary provided by the Premier League. In Asia, and select other countries around the world, there is also a fully produced studio broadcast where pre, half time and post-match analysis is offered. This is currently hosted by John Dykes. </P> <P> The 3:00pm (UK time) Saturday kick-offs are not allowed to be shown live in the UK due to the hours of 2.45 pm-5.15 pm being ' blocked broadcasting hours ', as requested by the FA and enforced by UEFA. In Ireland, a different situation applies ; a package of only one Saturday 3:00pm kick off each week (along with one game on the final Sunday) is sold as an addition to the UK live rights packages, this package is currently held by Sky Sports. While there is no rule prohibiting the screening of the other 3:00pm games in Ireland, the Premier League does not make the rights to these games available to Irish broadcasters, due to the overlap in reception that is possible in Northern Ireland and mainland England and not's total match completely absolute live in total all interviews season the paradox that total matches live other will only be seen on streaming sites of he Premier League TV. </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> (hide) <Ul> <Li> 1 Broadcasters <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Broadcasters by region <Ul> <Li> 1.1. 1 African broadcasters </Li> <Li>

Having a driver's permit for a certain length of time is usually one of the requirements (along with driver's education and a road test) for applying for a full driver's license. To get a learner's permit, one must typically pass a written permit test, traffic, and rules of the road. </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> (hide) <Ul> <Li> 1 Australia </Li> <Li> 2 Belgium </Li> <Li> 3 Canada </Li> <Li> 4 France </Li> <Li> 5 Germany </Li> <Li> 6 Hong Kong </Li> <Li> 7 India </Li> <Li> 8 Ireland </Li> <Li> 9 New Zealand </Li> <Li> 10 Norway </Li> <Li> 11 Singapore </Li> <Li> 12 South Africa </Li> <Li> 13 Sweden </Li> <Li> 14 United Kingdom </Li> <Li> 15 United States <Ul> <Li> 15.1 Learner's permits </Li> <Li> 15.2 Intermediate license </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 16 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Australia (edit) </H2> <P> Laws regarding learner's permits in Australia differ between states. However, all states require a number of hours supervised driving to be undertaken and for the permit to be held for a set period. The age to get a Learner Permit is 16 in all states and territories except the ACT where it is 15 and 9 months. When a person is on their learners permit, they have to log 50 -- 120 hours depending on the state they are in, and must obtain at least 5 night hours. They can be supervised or taught in their log book hours by any person/persons holding a full license. They must sign the log book for allocated hours. </P> <H2> Belgium (edit) </H2> <P> A provisional learners license can be obtained after passing a theoretical exam less than three years prior. The minimum age for a learners permit is 17 years. The learner needs to be accompanied by a designated person with a valid driving license. The vehicle needs to bear a clearly visible, predesignated \"learners\" sign, sporting the letter \"L\". </P> <H2> Canada (edit) </H2> <P> In Canada, the minimum age varies from province to province and may be 14 or 16. In Ontario, a G1 License is issued to new drivers at the age of 16 after completing a written test. G1 license restrictions include:</P> <Ul> <Li> Have time and/or road restrictions, and the learner must drive with a fully licensed driver of at least 4 years. After one year with a G2, the learner may upgrade to their full G class license by taking another road test, which has a major highway component. A similar program is in effect for motorcycles, the M class license. </Li> </Ul> <P> In Nova Scotia, a beginner's permit (L) is issued to new drivers after the age of 16 after a written test. The L license restrictions include:</P> <Ul> <Li> A fully licensed driver must sit in the seat adjacent the new driver </Li> <Li> There can not be additional other passengers </Li> <Li> The learner must have a blood alcohol count of 0 </Li> <Li> No time or road restrictions </Li> </Ul> <P> In Alberta, a learners permit is issued to those who complete a knowledge test, an eye exam and one who is 14 years of age or older. They 're then put into a GDL program with restrictions. Some include:having a 0 blood alcohol level, fully licensed driver in passenger seat, no more people than there are seats, and must hold the license for a one-year minimum before upgrading. </P> <P> In Alberta, one has to pass a basic road test after having a learner's permit for at least a year and at or over the age of 16, then can apply for a Class 5 GDL license, which carries some of the same restrictions, but no longer requires a fully licensed Class 5 non-GDL driver in the passenger seat. Once the person becomes 18 and holds the Class 5 GDL license for at least 2 years, they can do an advanced road test which if they pass, they 'll become a fully licensed Class 5 driver. </P> <H2> France (edit) </H2> See also:Driving licence in France <P> In France, exists a Graduated driver licensing for people between the age of 15 and 17 and half, for B Driving licence. </P> <P> Some restriction exist ; one of the main condition is that a fully agreed licensed must accompany the learner. </P> <P> With 18, the learner's permit can apply to a normal driving license, that it can pass more easily due to its previous experience ; additionally, its probation license is reduced from three to two years. </P> <P> This Graduated driver licensing is valid only within France, so it's not possible to cross their border with the Graduated driver licensing. </P> <P> For people over 18, a system similar to the Graduated driver licensing exists, but rules are slightly different, for instance it does not provide the reduction from three to two years for the probation licence. </P> <P> Furthermore, any person who initially gets a driving license, for the first one, has to mind following restrictions for two or three years known as permis probatoire. The permis probatoire starting with specific issue:</P> <Ul> <Li> Speed is reduced for new drivers:110 km/h instead of 130 on motorways, 100 km/h instead of 110, and 80 instead of 90 on rural roads. </Li> <Li> The permis probatoire has only six points, and the driver access to 12 points when the driver passes its three year term </Li> </Ul> <Table> Points <Tr> <Th> When </Th> <Th> General case </Th> <Th> Apprentissage anticipé case </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Driving licence passed </Td> <Td> 6 </Td> <Td> 6 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> After one year </Td> <Td> + 2 → 8 (if no point loss) </Td> <Td> + 3 → 9 (if no point loss) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> After two years </Td> <Td> + 2 → 10 (if no point loss) </Td> <Td> + 3 → 12 (if no point loss) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> After three years </Td> <Td> + 2 → 12 (if no point loss) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Some training to road traffic safety might help to recover points. </P> <H2> Germany (edit) </H2> <P> Since 2010, it's possible to get a learner's permit at 17 in Germany. The only restriction is that a fully licensed and previously stated driver who is at least 30 years old must accompany the learner (but is not allowed to intervene in the drive). That does not apply to light motorcycles, which can be driven freely with this license. </P> <P> Furthermore, any person who initially gets a driving license has to mind following restrictions for 2 years starting with its issue:</P> <Ul> <Li> The driver must have a blood alcohol count of 0 (this applies at least until the age of 21) </Li> <Li> Any penalties are stricter than for advanced drivers </Li> </Ul> <P> With 18, the learner's permit will be automatically replaced by a normal driving license-no further test is needed. These legal circumstances in Germany are comparable to those in Austria in that matter-thus, it's possible to cross their border with a learner's permit. </P> <H2> Hong Kong (edit) </H2> <P> In Hong Kong any person aged 18 or above can apply for a Learner's Driving License for private cars, light goods vehicle and motorcycles. For other types of vehicle the age required is 21 and the applicant must have a valid private car or light goods vehicle driving license for 3 years. Unlike other jurisdictions, a learner must be supervised by an approved driving instructor instead of an ordinary fully licensed driver, or attending an approved driving school to learn to drive (except motorcycles, which learners can drive on their own, but motorcycle learners must pass a motorcycle course from an approved driving school before they can learn to drive on road). L-plate is also required when the learner is practicing. </P> <H2> India (edit) </H2> <P> In India, the minimum age at which a provisional licence is valid is 18 (and 16 for riding a gear less scooter). When driving under a provisional license, the learner must be accompanied by a driver who holds a full driving license. The supervisor has to be in view of the road and be in a position to control the vehicle. The provisional license is available only after passing the theory test. A full licence can be acquired only after passing the driving test. Once the learner has passed the theory test, they may take the practical driving test. Once the practical driving test has been taken and passed, a full driving licence will be automatically issued. While it is possible to take both tests immediately after each other, most learner drivers take a period between taking the theory and applying for a practical test to carry out driving lessons, either with their supervisor or a professional Driving school. </P> <P> The vehicle being driven by the learner must also be fitted with L-plates on both the back and front of the vehicle. This tells other road users that the vehicle is being operated by a driver without their full license and that they may make mistakes easily and that the driver may not be fully competent yet. The L-plate consists of a white square plate with a large red L in the middle. </P> <H2> Ireland (edit) </H2> <P> In Ireland the learner may perform a theory test at the age of 16 which tests their knowledge of traffic situations and road signs. Upon passing this test the learner will receive a learner's permit which permits them to drive on the road accompanied by a full licensed driver who has had their license for more than two years. The only restrictions are that the learner driver can not drive on motorways and must visibly display ' L ' plates at all times. They must have held their learner's permit for 6 months before they can apply to perform road test to obtain their full license. This is known as the ' six-month rule '. </P> <H2> New Zealand (edit) </H2> <P> In New Zealand any person 16 years or over can sit a learner's licensing test, which is a theory multiple choice test on road rules. Once they have passed this, they may drive with an adult who has had their full license for at least two years. They must display L plates at all times when driving. They may drive up to the speed of 100 km/h in allowed areas. They may carry passengers with an adult in the car that has had their full licence for more than two years. After at least 6 months have passed, they take a road test in order to receive their restricted license. On a restricted license, the learner may only drive between 5am and 10pm, with no passengers other than their dependent children, spouse, or persons holding a full license for more than 2 years. A learner may only drive between 5am and 10pm. Learners who sit the practical test in an automatic car are only legally allowed to drive an automatic while restricted. People can also sit a full license road test after 18 months or a year if they have undertaken a defensive driving course. In March 2010 the New Zealand Government announced changes to licence regulations which included raising the minimum age for a learner's licence to 16, since September 2011 the minimum age to attempt to obtain a learners licence is the age of 16. </P> <H2> Norway (edit) </H2> <P> In Norway, the learner may drive as long the learner is over 16 years of age, have passed a basic course in the rules of the road and first aid, and a person 25 or above who has had their driver's license for more than 5 years is present. </P> <H2> Singapore (edit) </H2> <P> In Singapore, any persons aged 18 or above may obtain a provisional driving licence for a fee of S $25.00 after passing the Basic Theory Test. The provisional driving licence is valid for 6 months if the PDL licence is obtained before 1 December 2017. From 1 December 2017, the validity of a PDL licence is 2 years from the date of payment, with no change of cost. It permits the holder to drive on public roads (with a few exceptions) in the presence of a Certified Driving Instructor. A car driven by a learner must display an L-plate on the front and rear of the car. Passing the Final Theory Test enables a learner to apply for the Practical Driving Test and it is valid for 2 years. A valid provisional driving licence, passed FTT and a photo ID must be presented to be allowed to take the practical test. Should a learner's provisional driving licence expire before the date of their practical test, he or she will have to renew it at the same cost. Expired PDL are not accepted and taking the practical tests will be rejected. </P> <P> A Qualified Driving Licence (QDL) is awarded to a person who has passed the practical test and made a one-time payment of S $50.00. Any person who has possessed a QDL for a period of less than a year is required to display a probation plate at the top right of their front and rear windscreens. The probation plate is made of a reflective material and consists of an orange triangle on a yellow background. Failure to do so may cause the offending driver to receive a fine for the first time and then subsequently revoked from driving. See Driving licence in Singapore for detailed requirements of each class of licence. </P> <H2> South Africa (edit) </H2> <P> A South African learners license consists of three sections with the following criteria required:</P> <Ul> <Li> Rules of the road-There are 30 questions in this category with 22 being the pass mark </Li> <Li> Vehicle controls-There are 8 questions in this section, the required pass mark is 6 </Li> <Li> Road signs, road markings and traffic signals-There are 30 questions in this category with a pass mark of 23 </Li> </Ul> <P> There are primarily three codes to choose from:</P> <Ul> <Li> Code 1-This is for motorcycles, motorised tricycle or quadrucycle not more than 125cc and the driver should be 16 or older on the date of the test. If the motorcycle engine in above 125cc, the driver will need to be 17 years or older. </Li> <Li> Code 2-This is for motor vehicles, bus and minibus or goods vehicle up to a maximum vehicle mass of 3500 kg. The driver will need to be 17 years or older on the date of the test. </Li> <Li> Code 3-This is for motor vehicles exceeding a gross vehicle mass of 3500 kg. The driver will need to be 18 years or older to apply for a learners license in this category. </Li> </Ul> <P> The following documents will need to be presented when applying for a learners license:</P> <Ul> <Li> Identity card or passport </Li> <Li> 2 Recent passport size photographs (colour or black and white) </Li> </Ul> <P> In South Africa, any person who is of the minimum required age and holds a valid ID document may sit a learner's licence exam. The minimum required age varies by vehicle class and has the following minimum age restrictions:</P> <Ul> <Li> for a motorcycle (without a sidecar) with an engine not exceeding 125 cc -- 16 years </Li> <Li> for light motor vehicles with a mass not exceeding 3 500 kilograms -- 17 years </Li> <Li> for all other vehicles (also motorcycles with an engine exceeding 125 cc) -- 18 years </Li> </Ul> <P> The Learner's Licence exam is a 68 question multiple choice exam with questions spread over three sections:Rules of the road (30 questions) ; Signs, signals and road markings (30 questions), and vehicle controls (8 questions). The holder of a learner's licence is allowed to drive only when supervised by a licensed driver. If the category of vehicle being driven requires a professional driving permit, the licensed driver must also hold a professional driving permit. South African Learners must carry their Learner's Licence with them whenever they are driving a vehicle and have L plates on the rear window. The Learner's Licence is valid for 24 months. </P> <H2> Sweden (edit) </H2> <P> In Sweden, the minimum age is 16 years old to get a basic car learner's permit ; 17 years and six months are required for more advanced light vehicle combinations and up to 23 years for heavy vehicle combinations. Körkortslag 4kap 2 § </P> <H2> United Kingdom (edit) </H2> <P> In the United Kingdom, the minimum age at which a provisional licence is valid is 17 (16 for driving a tractor, riding a moped, or those receiving Disability Mobility Allowance). When driving under a provisional licence, the learner must be accompanied by a driver who has held a full driving licence for three years, and who is 21 or over. The supervisor has to be in view of the road, however the road safety act 1988 states that the supervisor does not have to be in the passenger seat, although the passenger in the front seat does have to be over the age of 15. A full licence can be acquired as soon as the provisional licence is received, unlike many other countries where applicants must wait a minimum of 6 -- 12 months with this being said, before getting a full license. The provisional licence is available without taking a test, although to get a full, unrestricted licence-the applicant must take a written ' Theory ' test containing fifty multiple choice questions and fourteen-clip hazard perception test, both of which are done on a computer at one of the many DSA (Driving Standards Agency) Test centres. Once the learner has passed the theory test, they may take the practical driving test, however the practical driving test has to be done within 2 years of completing the theory test, as the theory test certificate expires 2 years after receiving it. Once the practical driving test has been taken and passed a full driving licence will be automatically issued. While it is possible to take both tests immediately after each other, most learner drivers take a period between taking the theory and applying for a practical test to carry out driving lessons, either with their supervisor or a professional Driving school. </P> <P> The vehicle being driven by the learner must also be fitted with L-plates on both the back and front of the vehicle. This tells other road users that the vehicle is being operated by a driver without their full licence and that they may make mistakes easily and that the driver may not be fully competent yet. The L-plate consists of a white square plate (often tied to the vehicle or attached by magnets) with a large red L in the middle. In Wales the L-plate or the D-plate may be used due to bilingual laws in effect in Wales. If the vehicle is operated by multiple named drivers (As specified by the car insurance policy), then the L-Plate should be removed and stored if the current driver holds a full licence. When the learner has passed, they can get a non-compulsory ' P ' plate, which shows that they have just passed their test, and so may not have much experience on the road. The P plate has a white background, with a green ' P '. </P> <P> In the UK, provisional licence holders are disallowed from driving on motorways until they pass the practical test. </P> <P> After gaining a full licence, the driver is subject to a probationary period ; 6 or more penalty points accumulated within 2 years of passing the test, will lead to a revocation of the licence and both test will need to be retaken. </P> <P> In Northern Ireland for one year after the passing of a driving test, the driver is defined as a \"restricted driver\" who must not exceed 45 mph (72 km/h) and must display an \"R-plate\" consisting of an amber sans-serif R on a white background. </P> <H2> United states (edit) </H2> <P> In the United States, it is typical for states to have graduated driver's license programs through which a driver first obtains a learner's permit, qualifies for an intermediate driver's license, and then ultimately qualifies for a full driver's license. The rules governing learner's permits can vary significantly by state. </P> <H3> Learner's permits (edit) </H3> <P> In order for a minor to receive a learner's permit, sometimes called an instructional permit, states typically require that the minor have signed permission from a parent or guardian. In the state of New Hampshire, a permit is not given but the young driver may begin to drive with a parent or guardian, or an adult 25 years of age, at the age of 15 and a half. </P> <P> Typically, a driver operating with a learner's permit must be accompanied by an adult licensed driver who is at least 21 years of age or older and in the passenger seat of the vehicle at all times. </P> <P> In some states, permit holders are allowed to drive to and from school or work with a permit, without a supervising driver. In Indiana, Iowa, Texas, Rhode Island, Maryland and Kentucky, a permit holder between 17 and 18 may legally drive unaccompanied only if heading to work or to school. </P> <P> After a legally defined period of driving supervised with a permit, usually between six and twelve months, and upon reaching the requisite age, the holder of a learner's permit can apply for a provisional license. Obtaining a provisional license allows certain restrictions to be lifted from the driver, such as the times that they are allowed to drive, and the number of people allowed in the car. </P> <P> The permit holder is required to document specific hours of driving under the permit before qualifying for an intermediate license, such as fifty hours of practice. </P> <H3> Intermediate license (edit) </H3> <P> An intermediate or provisional license allows the driver to drive a vehicle without supervision by a licensed driver. Driving is typically permitted during a limited range of mostly daylight hours, as well as to and from school, work and religious activities. Some states may require a road test before allowing a learner's permit holder to obtain an intermediate license. </P> <P> In order to qualify for a provisional license the applicant must typically be at least the age of 16 and must have previously held an learner's permit for at least six months. These requirements vary by state. For example, in Florida the prior period for holding a learner's permit is twelve months. </P> <P> In many states the period of driving on a learner's permit is shortened if the applicant is above the age of eighteen. For example, in Oklahoma if a driver is 18 or older a learner's permit must only be held for one month before the driver qualifies for an intermediate license. Some states allow drivers over the age of twenty-one to bypass the entire graduated licensing process. For example, in Colorado, a driver over the age of twenty-one may apply for and pass the tests for a permit and a full driver's license on the same day and, if successful in passing the tests, may obtain a full driver's license as soon as the driver passes a scheduled driving test. </P> <P> Intermediate drivers are normally restricted in their transportation of passengers, especially minor passengers, without supervision. In some states, such as California, Nebraska, Oregon, Maine, New York, Florida, Kansas, Illinois, Oklahoma and Arizona, permitted drivers may legally drive family members under the age of 21 without adult supervision if they possess a signed note from a legal guardian. </P> <H2> References (edit) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F21012 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F2390 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ https://www.permisapoints.fr/permis-a-points/permis-probatoire/ </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F2390 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ (NDLS, National Driver Licensing Service, 2017) </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ \"About your licence\".

White, John Corbett, Shane Harper, Benjamin Onyango, Ted McGinley, Jennifer Taylor, Tatum O'Neal, Shwayze and Cissy Houston. </P> <P> Principal photography was completed in Little Rock, Arkansas in December 2017. It was released in the United States on March 30, 2018. Unlike the first two films, A Light in Darkness was a box office bomb, making less in its entire theatrical run ($5.7 million) than the others grossed in their respective opening weekends ($9.7 million and $7.6 million). </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> (hide) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot summary </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Production </Li> <Li> 4 Reception <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Box office </Li> <Li> 4.2 Critical response </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot summary (edit) </H2> <P> After a bunch of protests by college students against the church of St. James, the college starts the process of shutting down the church much to the dismay of Reverend Dave and his partner Jude. When informed of the decision to shut down the church and to replace it with a building to expand the school, Dave and Jude begin the process of suing the college to save St. James. Things get worse when college student Adam Richertson, a struggling Christian, in protest, tosses a brick into the church, igniting a fire that fatally wounds Jude. Reverend Dave is forced to come to grips with the loss of his dear friend. Adam is horrified by his actions and contemplates whether to confess to the crime, leading him to rediscover his faith in God. </P> <P> During the lawsuit, Dave seeks the help of his estranged brother, attorney Pearce Hill, who tries to explain to Dave that it is not a case worth fighting for. Dave refuses to listen to his brother's advice and continues the case into court. After failing to reach a settlement with the college, the trial date is set for the lawsuit. At the same time, Adam sends an anonymous text to Reverend Dave confessing to the church fire and a furious Dave assaults him when confronting him. This severely wounds his lawsuit's case and leads to Adam being arrested and charged as a felony case. </P> <P> After seeking God's help in church through prayer, Reverend Dave eventually realizes that his case has only made things worse and that St. James is not the right church for God and his followers. He drops his lawsuit, reaches an out-of-court settlement with the college, and after talking with a repentant Adam and consulting with Jude's family, ultimately asks to have the criminal charges against Adam dropped.

It ended up debuting to just $2.6 million, finishing 12th at the box office and marking the lowest opening of the series. Deadline Hollywood noted the film suffered from being the third film of a trilogy and also said religious audiences saw the film as \"a cash grab and not a movie promoting a Christian message anymore\", and were more inclined to go to other faith-based films in theaters like I Can Only Imagine and Paul, Apostle of Christ. It fell 58% in its second weekend to $1.1 million, finishing 17th. By the end of its North American run the film grossed a total of $5.5 million, less than other two films grossed simply in their opening weekends ($9.7 million and $7.6 million, respectively). </P> <H3> Critical response (edit) </H3> <P> On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 13% based on 15 reviews, and an average rating of 2.7/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 33 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A --\" on an A+ to F scale, though as with the second film, Deadline Hollywood noted that \"faith-based films have an easy time gaining an A on CinemaScore\". </P> <H2> References (edit) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ \"God's Not Dead:A Light in Darkness (2018)\".

It is coordinated by the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL), a nonprofit organization formed by an agreement with US lotteries. Powerball's minimum advertised jackpot is $40 million (annuity) ; Powerball's annuity is paid in 30 graduated installments or winners may choose a lump sum payment instead. One lump sum payment will be less than the total of the 30 annual payments because of the time value of money. </P> <P> Drawings for Powerball are held every Wednesday and Saturday evening at 10:59 p.m. Eastern Time. Since October 7, 2015, the game has used a 5/69 (white balls) + 1/26 (Powerballs) matrix from which winning numbers are chosen, resulting in odds of 1 in 292,201,338 of winning a jackpot per play. Each play costs $2, or $3 with the Power Play option. (Originally, Powerball plays cost $1 ; when PowerPlay began, such games were $2.) The official cutoff for ticket sales is 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time ; some lotteries cut off sales earlier. The drawings are usually held at the Florida Lottery's studio in Tallahassee. </P> <P> On January 13, 2016, Powerball produced the largest lottery jackpot in history ; the $1.586 billion jackpot was split by three tickets sold in Chino Hills, California, in Munford, Tennessee, and in Melbourne Beach, Florida. </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> (hide) <Ul> <Li> 1 Powerball members <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Mega Millions and Powerball </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 History <Ul> <Li> 2.1 1988 precursor:Lotto * America </Li> <Li> 2.2 Powerball begins </Li> <Li> 2.3 2009:Florida became host to drawings </Li> <Li> 2.4 2010 cross-sell expansion </Li> <Li> 2.5 2012 format change </Li> <Li> 2.6 2015 format change </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Playing the game <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Basic game </Li> <Li> 3.2 Power Play </Li> <Li> 3.3 Prizes and odds </Li> <Li> 3.4 Jackpot accumulation and payment options </Li> <Li> 3.5 Claiming prizes </Li> <Li> 3.6 Secondary prizes </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Notable wins </Li> <Li> 5 Fortune cookie payout </Li> <Li> 6 Computers and slot machines </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Powerball members (edit) </H2> U.S. lotteries.

Alaska, Hawaii, Mississippi, Nevada and Utah do not sell lottery tickets. In 2013, Wyoming became the 44th state to establish a lottery ; the next year, it began, initially offering both Mega Millions and Powerball. </P> <H2> History (edit) </H2> <H3> 1988 precursor:Lotto * America (edit) </H3> <P> Powerball's predecessor began in 1988 ; the multi-state game was known as Lotto * America. The game, and name, were changed to Powerball on April 19, 1992 ; its first drawing was held April 22. </P> <H3> Powerball begins (edit) </H3> <P> When it was launched in 1992 Powerball became the first game to use two drums. Using two drums to draw numbers from offers more manipulation by simultaneously allowing high jackpot odds, numerous prize levels and low overall odds of winning (as explained later, a ticket can win by matching only one number). The two-drum concept was suggested by Steve Caputo of the Oregon Lottery. The two-drum concept has since been used by The Big Game (now Mega Millions) in the US, Australia's Powerball, Thunderball in the UK, Eurojackpot and EuroMillions (unlike most two-drum games, Euromillions selects two numbers called \"Lucky Stars\" from the 2nd drum ; jackpot winners must make a total of seven matches). </P> <P> Through 2008, Powerball drawings usually were held at Screenscape Studios in West Des Moines, Iowa. The drawings' host was longtime Iowa radio personality Mike Pace, who had hosted MUSL drawings since Lotto * America began in 1988. In 1996, Powerball went \"on the road\" for the first time, holding five remote drawings at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. A few weeks later, Georgia became the only jurisdiction to leave Powerball (Maine, which joined MUSL in 1990, left when Powerball began). In August 1996, Georgia joined the then-new The Big Game, then the other major U.S. lottery group. It planned to sell tickets for both games for the rest of 1996 ; but within days Georgia was removed from MUSL, not to return until the 2010 cross-sell expansion. </P> <P> On November 2, 1997, the annuity was changed from 20 to 25 yearly payments ; the cash option was added. The annuity comprises 30 graduated payments, increasing 5% annually. </P> <P> In 1998, Florida was given permission by its government to participate in a multi-state game. It was set to offer Powerball ; but in early 1999, new governor Jeb Bush prevented Florida from joining since he believed Powerball would hurt the existing Florida Lottery games. In 2008, Governor Charlie Crist finally allowed Florida to join MUSL, on Jan 4, 2009. </P> <P> On March 7, 2001, an optional multiplier (called Power Play) was added, allowing players to multiply non-jackpot winnings by up to five by paying an extra $1 per game. A wheel was introduced to select the Power Play multiplier for each drawing (the next year, the 1x was removed from the Power Play wheel.) </P> <H3> 2009:Florida became host to drawings (edit) </H3> <P> With the start of Powerball sales in Florida on January 4, 2009 (with its first drawing on January 7), the matrices changed to 5/59 + 1/39 (adding four white ball numbers and dropping three red balls). This changed the jackpot probability from 1:146 million to 1:195 million ; the overall probability became 1:35. </P> <P> Based on statistical projections, the average jackpot win increased from $95 million to $141 million. Over 3.5 million additional prizes were expected to be won yearly due to the change in probability. The starting jackpot increased to $20 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The jackpot contribution increased from 30.3% to 32.5% of total sales. The Power Play option was modified ; second prize, usually $200,000, was given an automatic 5x multiplier, making the 5 + 0 prize $1 million cash. The bonus second prize if the jackpot exceeded its previous record by $25 million, triggered only twice, was eliminated with the 2012 format change. </P> <P> The conditions for Florida joining Powerball included a move of the live drawings from Iowa to Universal Studios in Orlando. The three hosts rotating announcing duties from Universal Studios were Tracy Wiu, Elizabeth Hart and Scott Adams (MUSL headquarters remained in Iowa, where its other draws are held). The wheel that was used to determine the Power Play multiplier was retired when the drawings moved to Florida ; a random number generator (RNG) was used until the 2012 format change. </P> <P> Arkansas became the 33rd MUSL member on October 31, 2009, the last to join before the 2010 cross-sell expansion. The Ohio Lottery added Powerball on April 16, 2010 ; it joined Mega Millions (along with New York) years earlier, when The Big Game added Mega Millions to its name. </P> <H3> 2010 cross-sell expansion (edit) </H3> <P> In March 2009, it was reported that New Jersey, already a Mega Millions member, sought permission to join Powerball. Shortly after, discussions were revealed about allowing each US lottery to offer both games. On Oct 13, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball. In Nov, MUSL signed an agreement to start streaming Powerball drawings online. </P> <P> On Jan 31, 2010, the date of the cross-sell expansion, Mega Millions and MUSL each added lotteries ; eight Powerball members added Mega Millions by May. The Montana Lottery joined Mega Millions on March 1. Nebraska added Mega Millions on March 20 ; Oregon followed on March 28 ; Arizona joined Mega Millions on April 18 ; Maine added Mega Millions on May 9 ; Colorado and South Dakota joined Mega Millions on May 16. The U.S. Virgin Islands joined Mega Millions in Oct 2010. </P> <P> Before the agreement, the only places that sold both Mega Millions and Powerball tickets were retailers straddling a border ; one retailer on the Sharon, Pennsylvania/Masury, Ohio border sold both Mega Millions (via the Ohio Lottery) and Powerball (Pennsylvania) before the agreement and continued to be the only retailer to sell tickets for both lotteries. </P> <P> Illinois joining Powerball on the expansion date, it became the second multi-jurisdictional lottery game (after Mega Millions, which Illinois already participated in) whose drawings were carried nationally. Both games' drawings were simulcast via Chicago cable superstation WGN-TV through its national WGN America feed. WGN-TV aired Illinois Lottery drawings nationally from 1992 to 2015 after acquiring broadcast rights from Chicago's Fox owned-and-operated station WFLD in 1988, which took the rights from WGN-TV in 1987. Powerball drawings were aired on WGN-TV and WGN America on Wednesday and Saturday immediately following the station's 9pm (Central Time) newscast with the Mega Millions drawings being aired Tue and Fri evenings after the newscast. WGN served as a default carrier of Mega Millions or Powerball where no local television station carries either multi-jurisdictional lottery's drawings. </P> <P> On March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first previous Mega Millions-only member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Powerball ticket. It was worth over $211 million in annuity payments ; it was sold in Morris Plains. On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first previous MUSL member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket ; that jackpot was $12 million (annuity). </P> <P> On June 2, 2010, Ohio won a Powerball jackpot ; it became the first lottery selling either Mega Millions or Powerball (when 2010 began) to provide a jackpot-winning ticket for its newer game. The ticket was worth a $261 million annuity ; it was sold in Sunbury. Ohio's second Powerball jackpot-winning ticket, sold for the June 23, 2010 drawing, was part of another first ; since Montana also provided a jackpot winner for that drawing, it was the first time a jackpot was shared through lotteries which sold competing games before the cross-selling expansion, as Montana sold only Powerball before the expansion date. </P> <H3> 2012 format change (edit) </H3> <P> On January 15, 2012, the price of each basic Powerball play doubled to $2, while PowerPlay games became $3 ; the minimum jackpot doubled to $40 million. A non-jackpot play matching the five white balls won $1 million. The red balls decreased from 39 to 35. The drawings were moved from Universal Studios Orlando to the Florida Lottery's studios in Tallahassee. Sam Arlen served as host, with Alexa Fuentes substituting. </P> <P> These changes were made to increase the frequency of nine-figure jackpots ; a Powerball spokesperson believed a $500 million jackpot was feasible (it became a reality within the year,) and that the 1st $1 billion jackpot in US history would occur by 2012 Less than three months after the Powerball changes, Mega Millions' jackpot reached $656,000,000 despite remaining a $1-per-play game. The random Power Play multiplier was retired for a set, fixed dollar amount payout. The $25 million rollover \"cap\" (creating larger 5 + 0 prizes) was eliminated. </P> <P> California joined on April 8, 2013 ; it has never offered the Power Play option, as all payouts in California Lottery drawing games, by law, are parimutuel. Mega Millions, which became available in California in 2005, offers its Megaplier in its other 45 jurisdictions. </P> <P> On January 22, 2014, the variable Power Play option returned (2x-5x) for multiplying non-jackpot prizes. </P> <P> In October 2014, Puerto Rico joined Powerball ; the first mainly Spanish-speaking jurisdiction offering the game ; as of 2016 it had not joined Mega Millions. </P> <H3> 2015 format change (edit) </H3> <P> On Oct 4, 2015, the Powerball format changed again ; the white-ball pool increased from 59 to 69 while the Powerball pool decreased from 35 to 26. While this improved the chance of winning any prize to 1 in 24, it also lengthened the jackpot odds to 1 in 292,201,338. The 4 + 1 prize became $50,000 ; the 10x PowerPlay became available in drawings with a jackpot of under $150 million. Three months later, the format produced a $1.5 billion jackpot, double the previous record, after 20 consecutive rollovers. </P> <H2> Playing the game (edit) </H2> <H3> Basic game (edit) </H3> <P> The minimum Powerball bet is $2. In each game, players select five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and one number from 26 red Powerballs ; the red ball number can be the same as one of the white balls. The drawing order of the five white balls is irrelevant ; all tickets show the white ball numbers in ascending order. Players can not use the drawn Powerball to match two of their white numbers, or vice versa. Players can select their own numbers, or have the terminal pseudorandomly select the numbers (called \"quick pick\", \"easy pick\", etc.). </P> <P> In each drawing, winning numbers are selected using two ball machines:one containing the white balls and the other containing the red Powerballs. Five white balls are drawn from the first machine and the red ball from the second machine. Games matching at least three white balls or the red Powerball win. </P> <P> Two identical machines are used for each drawing, randomly selected from four sets. The model of machine used is the Halogen, manufactured by Smartplay International of Edgewater Park, New Jersey. There are eight ball sets (four of each color) ; one set of each color is randomly selected before a drawing. The balls are mixed by a turntable at the bottom of the machine that propels the balls around the chamber. When the machine selects a ball, the turntable slows to catch it, sends it up the shaft, and then down the rail to the display. </P> <P> The double matrixes and probabilities in the game's history:</P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Starting date </Th> <Th> Pick 5 of </Th> <Th> Pick 1 of </Th> <Th> Jackpot chance </Th> <Th> Power Play multipliers </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> April 22, 1992 </Td> <Td> 45 </Td> <Td> 45 </Td> <Td> 1:54,979,154 </Td> <Td> none † </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> November 5, 1997 </Td> <Td> 49 </Td> <Td> 42 </Td> <Td> 1:80,089,127 </Td> <Td> none † </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> March 7, 2001 </Td> <Td> 49 </Td> <Td> 42 </Td> <Td> 1:80,089,127 </Td> <Td> 1 ×-5 × </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> October 9, 2002 </Td> <Td> 53 </Td> <Td> 42 </Td> <Td> 1:120,526,769 </Td> <Td> 2 ×-5 × </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> August 28, 2005 </Td> <Td> 55 </Td> <Td> 42 </Td> <Td> 1:146,107,961 </Td> <Td> 2 ×-5 × </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> January 7, 2009 </Td> <Td> 59 </Td> <Td> 39 </Td> <Td> 1:195,249,054 </Td> <Td> 2 ×-5 × </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> January 15, 2012 </Td> <Td> 59 </Td> <Td> 35 </Td> <Td> 1:175,223,510 </Td> <Td> none </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> January 19, 2014 </Td> <Td> 59 </Td> <Td> 35 </Td> <Td> 1:175,223,510 </Td> <Td> 2 ×-5 × </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> October 7, 2015 </Td> <Td> 69 </Td> <Td> 26 </Td> <Td> 1:292,201,338 </Td> <Td> 2 ×-5 × ; 10 × ‡ </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> † Power Play was introduced in 2001. ‡ 10 × available if jackpot is under $150 million. </P> <P> While Mega Millions and Powerball each have similar jackpot odds despite having a different double matrix (Mega Millions is 5/75 + 1/15), since Powerball is $2 per play, it now takes $584,402,676 (not counting Power Play side bets) on average to produce a jackpot-winning ticket. </P> <H3> Power Play (edit) </H3> <P> For an additional $1 per game, a player may activate the Power Play option. Activating it multiplies lower-tier winnings (base prize $50,000 or less) by up to 5, or 10 when the jackpot is under $150 million. Power Play is drawn separate from the 6 numbers. The 5 + 0 prize is automatically doubled to $2 million if Power Play is activated. </P> <P> The dilemma for players is whether to maximize the chance at the jackpot or increase lower-tier winnings. If a player selects a fixed amount of money to spend on tickets at a certain time, the player will give up one guess of the winning set of numbers every two times this player activates Power Play in respect of one of the purchased tickets. </P> <P> Power Play, when it began in 2001, was drawn with a special wheel. In 2006 and 2007, MUSL replaced one of the 5 × spaces on the Power Play wheel with a 10 ×. During each month-long promotion, MUSL guaranteed that there would be at least one drawing with a 10 × multiplier. The promotion returned in 2008 ; the ball landed in the 10 × space twice. After being absent in 2009, the 10 × multiplier returned in May 2010 (after the Power Play drawing was changed to RNG.)

Only a \"lottery\" was authorized by the state Lottery Act. Therefore, Power Play is not offered in California. </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to:$2,000,000 fixed for match 5 + 0 with Power Play as of 2012 format change. </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to:Power Play multipliers do not apply to jackpot. Jackpot is split among multiple winners. </Li> </Ol> <P> § Odds of winning 0 + 1 prize are 1:38.32 instead of 1:26 as there is the possibility of also matching at least one white ball. </P> <P> All non-jackpot prizes are fixed amounts (except in California) ; they may be reduced and paid on a parimutuel basis, with each member paying differing amounts for the same prize tier, if the liability exceeds the funds in the prize pool for any game member. </P> <H3> Jackpot accumulation and payment options (edit) </H3> <P> Jackpot winners have the option of receiving their prize in cash (in two installments ; one from the winning jurisdiction, then the combined funds from the other members) or as a graduated annuity paid in 30 yearly installments. Each annuity payment is 5% higher than in the previous year to adjust for inflation. </P> <P> The advertised estimated jackpot represents the total payments that would be paid to jackpot winner (s) should they accept the annuity option. This estimate is based on the funds accumulated in the jackpot pool rolled over from prior drawings, expected sales for the next drawing, and market interest rates for the securities that would be used to fund the annuity. The estimated jackpot usually is 32.5% of the (non-Power Play) revenue of each base ($1) play, submitted by game members to accumulate into a prize pool to fund the jackpot. If the jackpot is not won in a particular drawing, the prize pool carries over to the next drawing, accumulating until there is a jackpot winner. This prize pool is the cash that is paid to a jackpot winner if they choose cash. If the winner chooses the annuity, current market rates are used to calculate the graduated payment schedule and the initial installment is paid. The remaining funds in the prize pool are invested to generate the income required to fund the remaining installments. If there are multiple jackpot winners for a drawing, the jackpot prize pool is divided equally for all such plays. </P> <P> MUSL and its members accept all investment risk and are contractually obligated and liable to the winner to make all scheduled payments to annuity winners. If a jackpot ticket is not claimed, the funds in the prize pool are returned to members in proportion to the amount they contributed to the prize pool. The members have different rules regulating how unclaimed funds are used. </P> <P> When the Powerball jackpot is won, the next jackpot is guaranteed to be $40 million (annuity). If a jackpot is not won, the minimum rollover is $10 million. The cash in the jackpot pool is guaranteed to be the current value of the annuity. If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations, game members must contribute additional funds to the jackpot pool to cover the shortage ; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the jackpot is won in consecutive drawings. </P> <H3> Claiming prizes (edit) </H3> <P> A winning ticket must be claimed in the jurisdiction in which it was purchased, regardless of residence. The minimum age to play Powerball is 18, except in Nebraska (19) ; and Arizona, Iowa, and Louisiana (21). </P> <P> Generally, Powerball players do not have to choose cash or annuity unless they win a jackpot (then they usually have 60 days to choose.) Exceptions include Florida and Missouri ; the 60-day \"clock\" starts with the drawing, so a jackpot winner who wishes to take the cash option needs to make immediate plans to claim their prize. New Jersey and Texas require the cash/annuity choice to be made when playing ; in New Jersey, an annuity ticket can be changed to cash after winning, while in Texas, the choice is binding (when the cash option was introduced in 1997, all Powerball players had to make the choice when playing. This regulation was phased out by 1999.) All Powerball prizes must be claimed within a period ranging from 90 days to a year, depending on where the ticket was bought. </P> <P> Powerball winnings in California and Pennsylvania are subject to Federal income tax only. There is no state income tax in Florida, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and Wyoming, and only on interest and dividends in Tennessee and New Hampshire. Winnings from tickets purchased outside of one's home state may be subject to the income tax laws of both states (with possible credit based on the two jurisdictions.) </P> <H3> Secondary prizes (edit) </H3> <P> Unlike the jackpot pool, other prizes are the responsibility and liability of each participating lottery. All revenue for Powerball ticket sales not used for jackpots is retained by each member ; none of this revenue is shared with other lotteries. Members are liable only for the payment of secondary prizes sold there. </P> <P> Since the secondary prizes are defined in fixed amounts (except in California), if the liability for a given prize level exceed the funds in the prize pool for that level the amount of the prize may be reduced and the prize pool be distributed on a parimutuel basis and result in a prize lower than the fixed amounts given in the prize tables. Because the secondary prize pools are calculated independently, it is possible lower-tier prizes will differ among the game members. </P> <H2> Notable wins (edit) </H2> Main article:Lottery jackpot records § United States <P> Because the quoted jackpot amount is an annuity of 30 graduated annual payments, its cash value relative to the annuity fluctuates. The actual ratio depends on projected interest rates and other factors. MUSL starts with the cash value, built from a percentage of sales, and then calculates the advertised jackpot amount from that value, based on the average costs of the three best securities bids. </P> <P> On August 23, 2017, the owner of a Powerball ticket sold in Chicopee, Massachusetts won more than $750 million, one of the largest prizes in the lottery's history. </P> <P> On January 13, 2016, the world's largest lottery jackpot, an annuity of approximately $1.586 billion, was split among three Powerball tickets in Chino Hills, California, Melbourne Beach, Florida and Munford, Tennessee, each worth $528.8 million. Since there is no income tax in Florida or Tennessee (and California does not tax lottery winnings), the cash option after Federal withholdings is $187.2 million each. </P> <P> On May 18, 2013, the world's largest one-ticket jackpot, an annuity of approximately $590.5 million ($607 million today), was won by a Powerball ticket sold in Zephyrhills, Florida. On June 5, Florida Lottery officials announced the winner:Gloria C. MacKenzie, 84, who purchased the \"quick pick\" ticket at a Publix supermarket. MacKenzie chose the cash option of approximately $370.8 million, before Federal withholding ; Florida does not have a state income tax. </P> <P> Other winners in excess of $250 million:On December 25, 2002, Jack Whittaker, president of a construction firm in Putnam County, West Virginia, won $314.9 million ($419 million today), then a new record for a single ticket in an American lottery. Whittaker chose the cash option of $170 million, receiving approximately $83 million after West Virginia and Federal withholdings. </P> <P> On October 19, 2005, the West family of Jacksonville, Oregon won $340 million ($417 million today). The Wests chose the cash payout of $164.4 million (before withholdings), smaller than Whittaker's cash payout in 2002 due to a then-recent change in the annuity structure. </P> <P> A jackpot of $365 million ($434 million today) was won on February 18, 2006 by one ticket in Nebraska. It was shared by eight people who worked at a meatpacking plant. The group chose the cash option of approximately $177.3 million, before withholdings. </P> <P> On August 25, 2007, a jackpot worth $314 million ($363 million today) was won by a retired auto worker from Ohio ; that ticket was bought in Richmond, Indiana, a community that had previously sold a jackpot-winning ticket of over $200 million. </P> <P> In November 2011, three Greenwich, Connecticut, financial executives shared a jackpot of $254.2 million ($271 million today), the largest prize on a Connecticut-bought ticket. Choosing the cash option, the men split nearly $104 million after withholdings. The jackpot, at the time, was the 12th largest in Powerball history. </P> <H2> Fortune cookie payout (edit) </H2> <P> The Powerball drawing on March 30, 2005, produced 110 second-prize winners. The total payout to these winners was $19.4 million, with 89 winners receiving $100,000 each, while the other 21 winners received $500,000 each as they were Power Play selections. </P> <P> MUSL officials initially suspected fraud or a reporting error. However, all 110 winners had played numbers from fortune cookies made by Wonton Food Inc. of Long Island City, New York. The factory had printed the numbers \"22, 28, 32, 33, 39, 40\" on thousands of fortunes. The \"40\" in the fortune did not match the Powerball number, 42. None of the employees of Wonton Food played those numbers ; at the time, the closest game member was Connecticut. Since the ticket holders had won as result of a coincidence rather than foul play, the payouts were made. </P> <P> Had the fortune cookie given 42 as the Powerball number, these winners would have shared the $25 million jackpot:each $227,272 annuity or $122,727 cash (before withholdings). The fortune on the inspiring cookie read:\"All the preparation you 've done will finally be paying off.\" </P> <H2> Computers and slot machines (edit) </H2> <P> In 2006, WMS Gaming released a range of slot machines under the Powerball brand name. In 2007, the Oregon Lottery released a Windows Sidebar gadget that displays the winning numbers for Powerball in real-time. The gadget also provides large jackpot announcements. </P> <P> The New York Lottery introduced a Powerball scratchcard in 2010. Five winning numbers plus a powerball were printed across the top of the card, with 12 opportunities to match. Matching the winning numbers or the powerball won. The top prize was $1 million (annuity) ; unlike actual Powerball, there was no cash option for the top prize. </P> <H2> See also (edit) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Mega Millions </Li> <Li> Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL) </Li> <Li> Lottery jackpot records </Li> </Ul> <H2> References (edit) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ \"How Powerball manipulated the odds to create a $1.5 billion jackpot\".

Now, when the Powerball Lottery jackpot is reset after a win it will start at $40 million, tempting even more players in for those early draws. Another promise, that is sure to be popular with lottery players, is the introduction of more prizes. From January, Powerball players will have even better odds of winning a prize worth at least $1 million, and it's that fact that may soften the third and biggest ever change.
